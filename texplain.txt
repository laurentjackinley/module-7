	As the functions getting bigger I notice that the insert keep increasing, and it is the same with the append time but at some point from the smallArray to the
 mediumArray I see that the append time actually decrease to over 70 micro second instead of increasing. I think that the doublerAppend function scale better than the 
doublerInsert, because as the array getting bigger I notice that the Append function time to run does not increase as fast as the Insert one does and we can see the
difference from largeArray to extraLargeArray.
The reason why the doublerInsert function is slower is because everytime the function run because of the unshift which will add it at the beginning of the array
it will have to move everything in the array to place it at the beginning.
